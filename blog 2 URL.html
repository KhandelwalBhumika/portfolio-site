<h2>
    What is a URL?
</h2>
    
    <p>
        A URL, or <span>Uniform Resource Locator</span>, is effectively a unique web address. It represents the ‚Äúlocation‚Äù of a specific resource on the internet. The term URL refers to a subset of Uniform Resource Indicators (URIs) that, in addition to identifying the web resource‚Äîalso provides the means of locating it.

        All webpages are resources online and all have a URL. But not all URLs point to webpages. Every resource on the internet has a URL including: webpages, files, images, media, web applications, services, etc.

<h2>
    Protocol:
</h2>    
<p>
    The protocol in a URL determines how data is transferred between the host and a web browser (or client). HTTP and HTTPS (secure) are two of the most common protocols you‚Äôll find in most URLs, though there are other internet protocols such as FTP, DNS, DHCP, IMAP, SMTP, etc.

<h2>
    Domain:
</h2>    
<p>
    A domain name is the registered identification ‚Äústring‚Äù (or word/phrase) used by the Domain Name System to define a specific area of control and autonomy (aka a website location). A domain name is a level below the TLD. A single TLD may contain hundreds of thousands and even millions of individual ‚Äúsecond-level‚Äù domains. Domain may also be referred to as second-level domain. Examples of domain names are (in bold):<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>zvelo</b>.com</li>
    <li><b>apple</b>.com</li>
    <li><b>amazon</b>.com</li>
    <li><b>facebook</b>.com</li>
    <li><b>google</b>.com</li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Path:
</h2>    
<p>
    The path refers to the exact location of a page, post, file, or other asset. It is often analogous to the underlying file structure of the website. The path resides after the hostname and is separated by ‚Äú/‚Äù (forward slash). The path/file also consists of any asset file extension, such as images (.jpg or .png, etc.), documents (.pdf or .docx), and more. But not all URLs will display a path.For example: <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>https://www.example.com/blog/category/individual-article-name/ </li>
        <li>https://example.com/media/upload/filename.jpg</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>
    Query String / Parameters:
</h2>    
<p>
    Parameters are found at the very end of the URL or within the path, depending on the implementation. URL Parameters are represented in key/value pairs, beginning with a '?' and separated by an ampersand '&'. They can also be dynamically set in the path as values separated by slashes and other characters (depending on the system being used and how it's implemented). Parameters are commonly used for tracking and analytics‚Äîas well as encoding specific information for use within websites and applications.For example, a URL with parameters:
 <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>https://www.example.com/solutions?user=123&color=blue</li>
        <li>https://www.example.com/solutions/user/123/color/blue</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>
    Fragment:
</h2>    
<p>
    Any URL that contains a # character is a fragment URL. The portion of the URL to the left of the # identifies a resource that can be downloaded by a browser and the portion on the right, known as the fragment identifier, specifies a location within the resource: <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>http://example.com/?color=#ffff&amp;shape=circle </li>
        <li>http://www.httpwatch.com/features.htm#print</li>
    </ul>
