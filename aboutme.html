        Hello readers,<br>
        <p> Welcome to my portolio. My name is Bhumika Khandelwal. I'm 22 years old and I live in Pink City, Rajasthan.
            I am a B.Com graduate from Subodh College (2017-2020) and I completed my schooling from St. Xaviers School (2016-17).
        </p>

        <p>
            I studied for the UPSC CSE exam for four years(2017 - oct,2021) and took it twice. Unfortunately, I did not
            make
            it. So now I'm learning full stack development. Being from non-tech background, I was very sceptical about
            this
            career path. Fortunately, after much research, I discovered some very well-curated tech courses for students
            like me, and since then I am working on the same.
        </p>

        <p>My last four years has provided me with some essential intangibles such as curiosity to learn
            about new things, knowledge that I have gained across various verticals has given me much self-confidence
            and
            also I am a very determined and a hardworking individual. Apart from academics, you can find me trying out
            new cuisines, reading novels, indulging in fashion, dancing, painting, and travelling.</p>
